## [v0.1.0-alpha] - 2024-10-03

Technically this is the 12th or 15th iteration of Doze as a program,
so for clarity and hygiene I will make versions under v1.0 use a `alpha` tag
until the program is relatively useable (essentially when I settle on
the build configuration format and implement a parser). Anyway, that is
the first <<official>> doze release! :tada:

### Added

- This changelog file that will serve as journal for now.
- Procedures interface, topoSchedule to create a simple build plan.
- Minor CLI.
